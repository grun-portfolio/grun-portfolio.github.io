     <p>My two Software development projects for the Bavarian State Government are a combination of structured and iterative processes integrating requirements engineering and 
        Agile Scrum methodologies to create robust digital solutions. Starting with a comprehensive requirements development phase, the process focuses on gathering, analyzing, 
        and documenting stakeholder needs to establish a clear project foundation. This phase transitions seamlessly into an Agile Scrum development phase, where iterative cycles 
        and cross-functional collaboration drive the design, development, and delivery of software. By combining rigorous requirement analysis with adaptive Agile practices, this 
        approach ensures efficient alignment with user expectations while allowing for a binding requirement specification document mandatory for state contracts.</p>

    <h2>Requirements Engineering</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/sites/software_development/requirements_engineering.png" alt="Workflow" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">    
        <p>The process of detailed a priori requirements development and documentation is often viewed as Muda —a wasteful, anti-Agile practice— because it limits the ability to adapt 
            quickly to market changes or incorporate new functions and technologies. This rigidity arises from defining and documenting requirements months or even years before 
            development begins. However, specific constraints, such as the need for mandatory binding requirements documents, may necessitate a more documentation-heavy approach.</p>
	    <p>In the second phase, I implement an Agile Scrum framework, where our cross-functional team continuously re-evaluates and refines the previously defined requirements while 
            developing the software applications in iterative two-week sprints. This phase aligns with the principles of the Agile Manifesto. My primary focus is to deliver value by 
            maintaining a clear product vision, rigorously managing the product backlog, and steering the team toward achieving the product goal.<br>
            I prioritize creating a psychologically safe work environment that encourages open communication, mutual respect, and active listening within the team. 
            In my role as a Product Owner, I embrace the mindset of an entrepreneur, utilizing the collective ideas and expertise of the entire team to drive innovation and achieve 
            the best possible outcomes for the best user experience.</p>

        seven, she was even more beautiful than the queen herself.</p>
