     <p>Once upon a time, in the middle of winter, a queen sat by a window sewing. As she worked, she glanced outside and saw snow falling like feathers from the sky. 
        The window frame was made of black ebony, and as she gazed out, she pricked her finger with the needle. Three drops of blood fell on the snow, and the red looked so 
        beautiful against the white that she thought, "I wish I had a child with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood, and hair as black as ebony."</p>

        <p>Not long after, the queen gave birth to a little girl who was exactly as she had wished—her skin was as white as snow, her lips as red as blood, and her hair as black 
            as ebony. She named her Snow White. Sadly, the queen died soon after the child was born.</p>
	<p>A year later, the king married again. His new wife was very beautiful but also proud and vain. She could not tolerate anyone being more beautiful than she was. She owned 
        a magical mirror, and every day she would ask it:<br>
        "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?"<br>
        The mirror always answered:<br>
        "You, my queen, are the fairest of all."</p>

        <h1 id="roles_responsibilities">Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
	<p>The queen was content because she knew the mirror only spoke the truth. But Snow White grew up, and with each passing year, she became more beautiful. By the time she was 
        seven, she was even more beautiful than the queen herself.</p>
