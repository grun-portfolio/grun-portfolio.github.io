     <p>My two Software development projects for the Bavarian State Government are a combination of structured and iterative processes integrating requirements engineering and 
        Agile Scrum methodologies to create robust digital solutions. Starting with a comprehensive requirements development phase, the process focuses on gathering, analyzing, 
        and documenting stakeholder needs to establish a clear project foundation. This phase transitions seamlessly into an Agile Scrum development phase, where iterative cycles 
        and cross-functional collaboration drive the design, development, and delivery of software. By combining rigorous requirement analysis with adaptive Agile practices, this 
        approach ensures efficient alignment with user expectations while allowing for a binding requirement specification document mandatory for state contracts.</p>

    <h1 id="project_description">Project Description</h1>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong>Development of two digital solutions aimed at improving the efficiency and transparency of state conservation programs. 
            These solutions handle the processing of 
            applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong>Product Owner and Requirements Engineer</p>
    
    <h1 id="my_approach">My Approach</h1>
        <p>The project follows a hybrid approach that integrates structured requirements engineering with Agile Scrum practices to create robust and adaptable software solutions. 
            This methodology ensures that the project is built on a solid foundation of stakeholder needs while remaining flexible to changes throughout the development process.</p>
