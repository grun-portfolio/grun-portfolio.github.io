     <h1>Hi, my name is Tobias B. Grun</h1>
     <p>I started my career as a research scientist in biomimetics/bionics and marine ecology—fields that demand both a deep understanding of engineering and quantitative 
        methods. This combination of creativity and precision shaped my passion for solving complex problems and developing innovative technologies.<br>
        When I transitioned into software development, I quickly discovered the strengths of Agile approaches. The focus on adaptability, collaboration, and continuous 
        improvement resonated deeply with me. But I also recognized the critical importance of structure and clarity in requirements analysis. Every challenge has its own 
        unique demands, and the key is knowing when to apply the right approach.</p>

        <h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>
            <p>My goal is to drive value by aligning a clear product vision with a deep understanding of customer needs. I believe that strong collaboration between teams 
                and stakeholders, guided by Agile and Lean methodologies, is key to achieving this. By aligning teams around shared objectives, promoting continuous learning, 
                and ensuring effective communication, I lead cross-functional teams to deliver impactful projects that meet both customer expectations and business goals.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/software_development.html" target="_self">Software Development</a></h2>
        <p>In my software development projects for the Bavarian State Government, I combine structured requirements engineering with Agile Scrum methodologies to deliver robust 
            digital solutions. By integrating rigorous requirement analysis with iterative development cycles, I ensure alignment with user expectations while meeting the formal 
            requirements for state contracts.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/scrum.html" target="_self">Scrum</a></h2>
        <p>I follow the principles of Scrum, a framework that fosters collaboration, transparency, and adaptability in product development. By focusing on iterative delivery 
            and continuous feedback, Scrum empowers teams, enhances communication, and ensures alignment with stakeholder needs to maximize value.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/requirements_engineering.html" target="_self">Requirements Engineering</a></h2>
        <p>In requirements engineering, I focus on thoroughly gathering, analyzing, and documenting stakeholder needs to establish a clear and solid foundation for the project. 
            By fostering continuous collaboration with stakeholders, I ensure that requirements are well-defined, aligned with customer/user needs and business objectives to 
            deliver a comprehensive specification document that serves as the foundation for the implementation.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/project_management.html" target="_self">Project Management</a></h2>
        <p>In project management, I focus on defining clear objectives, creating detailed plans, and ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations to deliver projects efficiently 
            and effectively while meeting business goals.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/data.html" target="_self">Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Management</a></h2>
        <p>With a strong foundation in AI, ML, DL, and Data Management, I have developed a deep understanding of their principles, methodologies, and technologies. This knowledge 
            allows me to effectively oversee AI and data projects, ensuring alignment between business objectives and technical implementation while fostering innovation and efficiency.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/biomimetic_research.html" target="_self">Biomimetic Research</a></h2>
        <p>Biomimetic Research is an integrative approach combining biology and engineering sciences to address complex technical challenges. By examining evolved biological structures, 
            biomimetics seeks to extract working principles of biological role models that inspire innovative technical solutions. This process relies on computational analysis and mathematical 
            descriptions of the role models to manage and interpret intricate biological data, transforming raw observations into technical solutions. Through rigorous data analysis, biomimetics 
            turns the complexity of natural systems into a framework for advancing technology.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/ecological_research.html" target="_self">Ecological Research</a></h2>
        <p>In my ecological research, I study how marine organisms interact within their ecosystems, focusing on biotic interactions, spatial distribution patterns, 
            environmental factors, and habitat relationships. By combining field observations with experimental and analytical methods, I aim to understand how marine 
            organisms interact with their environments and how that affects biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.</p>
