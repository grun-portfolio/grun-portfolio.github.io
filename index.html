     <h1>Hi, my name is Tobias B. Grun</h1>
     <p>I started my career as a research scientist in biomimetics/bionics and marine ecology—fields that demand both a deep understanding of engineering and quantitative 
        methods. This combination of creativity and precision shaped my passion for solving complex problems and developing innovative technologies.<br>
        When I transitioned into software development, I quickly discovered the strengths of Agile approaches. The focus on adaptability, collaboration, and continuous 
        improvement resonated deeply with me. But I also recognized the critical importance of structure and clarity in requirements analysis. Every challenge has its own 
        unique demands, and the key is knowing when to apply the right approach.</p>

        <h1 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h1>
            <p>My goal is to drive value by aligning a clear product vision with a deep understanding of customer needs. I believe that strong collaboration between teams 
                and stakeholders, guided by Agile and Lean methodologies, is key to achieving this. By aligning teams around shared objectives, promoting continuous learning, 
                and ensuring effective communication, I lead cross-functional teams to deliver impactful projects that meet both customer expectations and business goals.</p>

        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/software_development.html" target="_self">Software Development</a></h2>
        <p>These two software development projects, where I served as both Requirements Engineer and Product Owner, involved creating software solutions for the Bavarian State 
            Government. Each project began with a rigorous requirements engineering phase to gather, analyze, and document stakeholder needs, establishing a clear foundation. 
            Development then transitioned to Agile Scrum, where cross-functional teams delivered and refined features through iterative sprints, continuously adapting to feedback 
            and evolving requirements.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/biomimetic_research.html" target="_self">Biomimetic Research</a></h2>
        <p>Biomimetic Research is an integrative approach combining biology and engineering sciences to address complex technical challenges. By examining evolved biological structures, 
            biomimetics seeks to extract working principles of biological role models that inspire innovative technical solutions. This process relies on computational analysis and mathematical 
            descriptions of the role models to manage and interpret intricate biological data, transforming raw observations into technical solutions. Through rigorous data analysis, biomimetics 
            turns the complexity of natural systems into a framework for advancing technology.</p>
        <h2><a href="https://grun-portfolio.github.io/ecological_research.html" target="_self">Ecological Research</a></h2>
        <p>In my ecological research, I study how marine organisms interact within their ecosystems, focusing on biotic interactions, spatial distribution patterns, 
            environmental factors, and habitat relationships. By combining field observations with experimental and analytical methods, I aim to understand how marine 
            organisms interact with their environments and how that affects biodiversity and ecosystem resilience.</p>
