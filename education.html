     <h1>Hi, my name is Tobias B. Grun</h1>
     <p>I started my career as a research scientist in biomimetics/bionics and marine ecology—fields that demand both a deep understanding of engineering and quantitative 
        methods. This combination of creativity and precision shaped my passion for solving complex problems and developing innovative technologies.<br>
        When I transitioned into software development, I quickly discovered the strengths of Agile approaches. The focus on adaptability, collaboration, and continuous 
        improvement resonated deeply with me. But I also recognized the critical importance of structure and clarity in requirements analysis. Every challenge has its own 
        unique demands, and the key is knowing when to apply the right approach.</p>
